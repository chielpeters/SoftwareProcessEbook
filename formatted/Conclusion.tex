Referrals have shown to be more effective than formal recruiting methods like newspaper advertisements and using agencies.
The job seeker that is referred will have in-side information about the job and is therefore more able to decide if the job will suit him or her.
The referred job seekers have a higher chance of being hired, since the employee referrer already did some pre-screening.
When the referred person starts working in the company they will have a change of fitting into the group that is already present. 
However, employee referrals will lead to people similar to the employee.
To keep the diversity in the company present it is recommended to keep using the formal advertisements beside referrals. 
In this way, a company is able to find people that might have a different view and keep up the diversity
